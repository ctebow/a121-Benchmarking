# Benchmarking an Acconeer A121 Radar Sensor

This project is for benchmarking the Acconeer A121 radar sensor for absolute rangefinding. The sensor is a breakout board from SparkFun, and is controlled by a Teensy board using the Arduino IDE and SparkFun's API.

Data analysis will be done using Python.
